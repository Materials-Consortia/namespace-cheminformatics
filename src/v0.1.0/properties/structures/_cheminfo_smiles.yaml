description: |-
  SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation of the structure.
  Values are RECOMMENDED to adhere to the OpenSMILES specification v1.0 (http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html).
  When structures or their parts cannot be unambiguously represented in SMILES according to OpenSMILES recommendations, using the guidelines from Quir√≥s et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-018-0279-6) is RECOMMENDED.
  Providers MAY canonicalize (i.e., use rules to establish the stable order of atoms) the produced SMILES representations, but this is not mandatory and no particular set of rules is recommended.
  Generally, providers SHOULD NOT change the representation more frequently than the structure itself is modified.
examples:
  - "c1ccccc1"
  - "CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C"
